## About
This application was mainly developed to practice and expand my understanding of the React framework. Since I was curious to see how the distribution would form when rolling any number of dice, I decided to use what I knew about states and functional components to make a visualization.

Future versions might include more parameters, but for now this is more than enough for something like Catan :).
